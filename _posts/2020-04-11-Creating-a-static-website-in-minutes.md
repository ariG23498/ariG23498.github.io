You need a `portfolio`? You want to write `blogs` too?

In this blog I will be writing down steps to create a `static website`. A static website is one with fixed content. This kind is perfect for our needs.

You cannot just have vanilla `HTML` and some text in your portfolio right?

Okay, you can, but that is not the point. Most of us would like our portfolios to have aligned pictures, cool fonts and soothing colors. Here we are slowling heading towards `CSS` to style our vanilla `HTML`. 

What if I told you that `raw text` would be enough to get yourself a cool website?

Enter `jekyll`. Jekyll is a static site generator. Its official documentation says, "You give it text written in your favourite markup language and it uses layouts to create a static website".

You make an awesome website, where do you host it now? `Github-Pages` lets each individual `GitHub` user host a website for free. ðŸ¤‘ðŸ¤‘ðŸ¤‘ I got you there at `free` didn't I?

> I am assuming that you already have a GitHub account. If you don't, this [wiki page](https://www.wikihow.com/Create-an-Account-on-GitHub) can be of help.

Our plan of action would be to:

* Creating a `default` jekyll website.
* Locally deploying the website.
* Being able to read a jekyll project.
* Tweaking our default site.
* Deploying the website with `GitHub-Pages`.
